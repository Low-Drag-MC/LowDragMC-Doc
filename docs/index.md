In essence, this is more of a **hub** for independent projects from myself and many talented developers rather than a structured team.  

We are dedicated to developing **creative mods** that offer **customization capabilities** to users, with a particular focus on **technical and rendering aspects**.  

### **Our Mod List**:
1. [**LDLib**](ldlib/index.md)  
2. [**Multiblocked & Multiblockded2**](multiblocked2/index.md)
3. [**Photon**](photon/index.md)  
4. **Shimmer**  

If you encounter any issues, feel free to **submit an issue**.  

If you enjoy our projects, contributions via **PRs** are always welcome! ðŸš€
