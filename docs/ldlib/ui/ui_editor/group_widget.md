# Group Widget

`Group` refers to widgets to which can accept child widgets

There are three built-in widgets so far: `Group`, `Scrollable Group`, and `Tab Group`.

`Group` is the most common widget, `Transform` will be applied to its children, and deletion and copy of the group are also applied to its children.

You can drag child's preview to adjust their order

Children in a `Scrollable Group` are hidden when they exceed the its size and allow users to scroll or drag groups to adjust the view.

The configurator has a lot of settings such as scroll bar styles, whether you can drag, etc. You can try them out yourself.

## Tab Group

As the name implies, `Tab group` allows you to set multiple tabs, which you can switch between different group views.
